My name is Thomas Garcia, I attended Fordham Prep, I was born on March 14, 2002 
and I enjoy playing video games on my computer, I've done 4 years of cross country 
for my high school as well. I also like watching anime.

* I'd like to learn more about the software engineering industry through 
the interview I'll have to complete at the end of this course.

* Since I'm new to coding and whatnot everything taught in this
class will be new to me.
